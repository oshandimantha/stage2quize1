mport Necessary Libraries:

Import the required Python libraries, such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
Load the Data:

Load your dataset from a CSV file using a library like pandas.
Prepare the Data:

Separate the input features (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable) from your dataset.
Train a Simple Linear Regression Model:

Fit a simple linear regression model using the input features and target variable.
Calculate the R^2 score to evaluate the model's goodness of fit.
Train Polynomial Regression Models:

For various degrees of polynomial regression (e.g., 2nd degree, 3rd degree, 4th degree), transform the input features into polynomial features.
Fit polynomial regression models for each degree using the transformed features.
Calculate the R^2 scores for each polynomial regression model.
Evaluate and Compare Models:

Display the R^2 scores for the simple linear regression model and polynomial regression models.
Analyze and compare the R^2 scores to assess how well each model fits the data.
Optional: Visualize the Results:

If desired, use matplotlib or a similar library to visualize the regression models and data points.
Plot the regression lines and data points to gain insights into the model's performance.
Conclusion:

Based on the R^2 scores and visualization (if done), draw conclusions about the suitability and accuracy of each regression model for your dataset.
